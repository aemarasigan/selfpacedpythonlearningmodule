In the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions and communities relied on the use of these gadgets to conduct meetings, to hold classes in the case of academic industries, and communicate with someone close to you or professionally related. Mobile gadgets became our means to make these easily possible.<br><br>\n",
        "Going towards a more particular setting such as in the academe, students rely in mobile gadgets in order to do usual daily academic-related things: scheduling appointments with professors and peers through email, submission of requirements through online platforms, facilitating meetings remotely through specific applications, and many more. Beyond that, they also use mobile gadgets for personal use that help them connect with people and peers personally known to them, get updated with trends and informations relevant to their interest, and even shop or sell online. Students can even access virtual platforms that enable them to earn income without the necessity of physically attending an office. Thus, we cannot deny how much mobile gadgets help students do their tasks more easily than before.<br><br>\n",
        "For students, ease of performing a lot due to online availability of doing it is good, however, with sufficient control into oneself. Recently, some debate that physical or mental health and academic performance arae being compromised; some would say otherwise. In this project, we will try to see if we can observe some connections or associations among students' demographics, mobile phone habits, and self-reported health and performance outcomes. Throughout this self-paced learning module, you will explore the use of Python as a computing and programming language, learn the use of control structures, perform calculations through functions, explore and use modules, packages and libraries, and use them to explore the dataset, calculate important measures, and get some observations through visualization.\n",

Afterward, basic Python syntax such as printing of output will be performed. This is followed by learning the different variable types and data structures. At the end of this module, you will execute operations on variables, check the output, and interpret results.\n",

This is essential when you want to perform a series of computations within your data that satisfy a pre-determined set of rules dictated by the user. The use of syntax such if, elif, and else are illustrated on a given scenario. To integrate a sequence of computation with a running index, loop structures are shown. Finally, there are also discussion on how important control statements like break, continue, or pass are used."

The conditional control structures enable the user to execute a command such as perform operations on objects if one or even more conditions are met. In order to do that, the user declares the conditions beforehand and declare the consequences once the conditions are satisfied. This is important for numerous reasons which will become more evident as we progress and finish this module. At the end, the user can efficiently run a block of code conditionally using Python's control structures.\n",

This is important when performing tasks like processing large datasets, automating repetitive computations, or scanning through elements of a list, file, or matrix. By the end of this module, you will be able to implement both conditional and looping structures in solving a wide variety of problems."
